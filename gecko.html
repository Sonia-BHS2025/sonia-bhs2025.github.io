    <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Crested geckos are arboreal, meaning they spend most of their time in trees. They are native to the rainforests of New Caledonia, where they thrive in humid and warm environments. In captivity, they require enclosures that mimic their natural habitat, including plenty of climbing structures and foliage for hiding.</p>

    <section id="behavior">
        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Crested geckos are nocturnal, becoming active at night to hunt and explore. They are generally docile and make great pets due to their calm demeanor. In the wild, they communicate through a series of clicks and chirps. When threatened, crested geckos can drop their tails as a defense mechanism, although the tail does not grow back as robustly as the original.</p>

    <section id="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>Crested geckos are omnivores, feeding on a diet of insects and fruit. In the wild, they eat a variety of insects, nectar, and overripe fruit. In captivity, they thrive on specially formulated gecko diets available in pet stores, which are often supplemented with live insects like crickets and mealworms.</p>

    <section id="reproduction">
        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>Crested geckos breed easily in captivity. Females lay eggs approximately 30 days after mating, usually two at a time. The eggs are buried in a moist substrate and hatch after about 60-90 days, depending on temperature and humidity. Hatchlings are independent from birth and can be fed the same diet as adult geckos.</p>

    <section id="conservation">
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>Once thought to be extinct, crested geckos were rediscovered in 1994 and have since become popular in the pet trade. They are currently not considered endangered, but habitat destruction and the pet trade pose potential threats to wild populations. Conservation efforts focus on habitat preservation and responsible breeding practices.</p>

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>I used to have 2 crested geckos which were named Banana and Marble! The differnt morphs that they can come in are awesome, and I love seeing them at reptile expos (though they can get quite pricey)!</p>
