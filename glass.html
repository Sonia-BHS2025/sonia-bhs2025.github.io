        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Glass catfish, known scientifically as Kryptopterus vitreolus, are fascinating freshwater fish prized for their transparent bodies. Native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, these fish are popular in aquariums due to their unique appearance and peaceful nature.</p>

    <section id="appearance">
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Glass catfish are notable for their translucent bodies, which allow their internal organs and spinal column to be visible. They have an elongated, slender shape and can grow up to 4 inches (10 cm) in length. Their fins are delicate and almost invisible, adding to their ghostly appearance.</p>

    <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Glass catfish inhabit slow-moving rivers, streams, and flooded fields in their native range. They prefer clear waters with plenty of vegetation and hiding spots. In the wild, they are often found in large schools, which provides them with protection from predators.</p>

    <section id="behavior">
        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Glass catfish are peaceful and social fish, often found swimming in schools. They are most active during the day and prefer to stay in the middle levels of the water column. In aquariums, they thrive when kept in groups of five or more, which reduces stress and mimics their natural schooling behavior.</p>

    <section id="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>In the wild, glass catfish primarily feed on small invertebrates, such as insects and crustaceans. In captivity, they can be fed a diet of high-quality flake or pellet food, supplemented with live or frozen foods like brine shrimp and daphnia to ensure proper nutrition.</p>

    <section id="reproduction">
        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>Breeding glass catfish in captivity can be challenging. They are egg scatterers, laying their eggs among plants or other substrate. The presence of soft, acidic water conditions and plenty of plant cover can encourage spawning. After hatching, the fry need to be carefully fed with infusoria and other tiny food sources.</p>

    <section id="conservation">
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>While not currently considered endangered, glass catfish face threats from habitat destruction and pollution in their natural range. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their natural habitats and promoting sustainable practices in the aquarium trade to ensure their populations remain stable.</p>
