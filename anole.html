        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The green anole (Anolis carolinensis) is a small, arboreal lizard known for its ability to change color and its agility. Native to the southeastern United States, these lizards are commonly found in gardens, forests, and urban areas. They are often referred to as the American chameleon due to their color-changing ability, although they are not true chameleons.</p>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Green anoles typically measure between 5 to 8 inches (12.5 to 20 cm) in length, including their tails. They are known for their vibrant green coloration, which can change to brown based on temperature, humidity, and mood. They have a slender body, long tail, and a distinctive pink dewlap (throat fan) used in displays of dominance and courtship.</p>

    <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Green anoles thrive in warm, humid environments and are commonly found in trees, shrubs, and on walls and fences. They prefer habitats with plenty of vegetation for cover and hunting grounds, including subtropical forests, wetlands, and residential gardens. Their arboreal nature allows them to escape predators and find food.</p>

    <section id="behavior">
        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Green anoles are diurnal and are most active during the day. They are territorial animals, with males often engaging in displays of aggression, including head bobbing and extending their dewlap to ward off rivals. These lizards are excellent climbers, using their adhesive toe pads to scale vertical surfaces. They also exhibit fascinating behaviors like tail autotomy, where they can shed their tail to escape predators.</p>

    <section id="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>The diet of green anoles mainly consists of small insects and other invertebrates. They hunt by sight, using their keen vision to spot prey. Common food items include crickets, flies, moths, and spiders. They may occasionally consume small fruits or nectar.</p>

    <section id="reproduction">
        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>Green anoles breed in the warmer months, typically from late spring to early fall. Females lay single eggs in moist, protected environments like leaf litter or soil. They may lay multiple eggs throughout the breeding season. The eggs hatch after about 5 to 7 weeks, and the young anoles are independent from birth, receiving no parental care.</p>

    <section id="conservation">
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>While green anoles are not currently considered endangered, they face threats from habitat destruction and competition with invasive species like the brown anole (Anolis sagrei). Conservation efforts focus on preserving their natural habitats and controlling invasive species populations to ensure the survival of green anoles in the wild.</p>
