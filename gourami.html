    <section id="appearance">
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Dwarf gouramis are known for their brilliant coloration, which includes shades of blue, red, and orange. Males are typically more brightly colored than females. They have a compressed body shape and long, flowing fins. Adult dwarf gouramis grow to about 2 to 3.5 inches (5 to 9 cm) in length.</p>

    <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>In the wild, dwarf gouramis are found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and rice paddies in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. They prefer habitats with abundant vegetation where they can hide and build bubble nests. In captivity, they thrive in well-planted aquariums with stable water conditions.</p>

    <section id="behavior">
        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Dwarf gouramis are generally peaceful and can be kept with other non-aggressive fish. Males can be territorial, especially during breeding. They are known for their labyrinth organ, which allows them to breathe air from the surface, enabling them to survive in low-oxygen environments. They often exhibit a curious and social behavior, interacting with their tank mates and exploring their surroundings.</p>

    <section id="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>Dwarf gouramis are omnivores and have a varied diet in the wild, consisting of small insects, algae, and other plant matter. In an aquarium setting, they can be fed a diet of high-quality flake food, pellets, and occasional live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp and bloodworms.</p>

    <section id="reproduction">
        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>During breeding, male dwarf gouramis build bubble nests at the water surface using bubbles and plant material. The male courts the female by displaying his vibrant colors and performing a dance. After the female lays eggs, the male guards the nest and tends to the eggs until they hatch. The fry are tiny and require specialized care to ensure their survival.</p>

    <section id="conservation">
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>Dwarf gouramis are not currently considered endangered, but their populations in the wild are affected by habitat destruction and pollution. Conservation efforts focus on maintaining healthy wild populations and promoting sustainable practices in the aquarium trade.</p>
