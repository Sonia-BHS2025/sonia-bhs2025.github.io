        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Nautiluses are marine mollusks belonging to the family Nautilidae, and they are the only extant members of the subclass Nautiloidea. Often referred to as living fossils, nautiluses have remained relatively unchanged for millions of years. They are known for their distinctive coiled shells and have fascinated scientists and marine enthusiasts alike.</p>

    <section id="appearance">
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Nautiluses are easily recognizable by their coiled, chambered shells, which can reach up to 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter. The shell is divided into multiple chambers, which the nautilus uses to regulate buoyancy by controlling the gas and liquid within them. The exterior of the shell is usually marked with brown and white patterns, while the interior is lined with mother-of-pearl. Nautiluses have numerous tentacles, around 90, that lack suckers but are used for capturing prey.</p>

    <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Nautiluses are typically found in the deep slopes of coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific region, including areas around Fiji, Samoa, and the Great Barrier Reef. They inhabit depths ranging from 300 to 600 meters during the day and come up to shallower waters around 100 meters at night to feed. These depths provide the nautilus with protection from predators and a stable environment.</p>

    <section id="behavior">
        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Nautiluses are nocturnal, meaning they are most active during the night. They use jet propulsion to navigate the water, expelling water through a siphon to move. Nautiluses spend most of their time in deep waters but ascend to shallower areas at night to feed. Their tentacles are highly sensitive and used to explore the environment and capture prey. When threatened, nautiluses can withdraw entirely into their shells, sealing themselves off with a tough hood for protection.</p>

    <section id="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>The diet of nautiluses consists mainly of small crustaceans, fish, and carrion. They use their tentacles to catch prey and then use a strong beak to break the food into manageable pieces. Nautiluses are opportunistic feeders and will scavenge for food, making them important players in their ecosystem by helping to clean the ocean floor of dead and decaying matter.</p>

    <section id="reproduction">
        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>Nautiluses reproduce through internal fertilization. Females lay eggs that are large and encased in a tough, leathery shell. These eggs are attached to rocks or other hard surfaces and take about 9 to 12 months to hatch. Unlike many marine animals, nautilus offspring, known as hatchlings, are miniature versions of adults and receive no parental care. They are fully capable of swimming and feeding from birth.</p>

    <section id="conservation">
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>Nautiluses are not currently listed as endangered, but they face threats from overfishing and habitat destruction. Their beautiful shells are highly prized in the ornamental shell trade, leading to increased fishing pressures. Conservation efforts focus on regulating trade and protecting their natural habitats to ensure the survival of these ancient mariners.</p>
