        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Monitor lizards vary greatly in size and coloration. They generally have elongated bodies, strong limbs, and long tails. Their skin is covered in rough, durable scales, which protect them from predators and environmental hazards. Sizes range from the small dwarf monitors, which are around 8 inches (20 cm) long, to the massive Komodo dragon, which can reach lengths of up to 10 feet (3 meters) and weigh over 150 pounds (70 kg).</p>

    <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Monitor lizards inhabit a variety of ecosystems, including forests, savannas, deserts, and mangroves. They are highly adaptable and can often be found near water sources. Some species, like the Nile monitor, are semi-aquatic, while others, like the Komodo dragon, prefer dry, arid environments.</p>

    <section id="behavior">
        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Monitor lizards are known for their intelligence and complex behaviors. They are solitary animals, except during the breeding season. Many species are diurnal, actively hunting and foraging during the day. Monitors use their strong limbs and sharp claws for climbing, digging, and capturing prey. They are also known for their ability to swim well, with some species spending a significant amount of time in water.</p>

    <section id="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>Monitor lizards are carnivorous and have a diverse diet that includes insects, crustaceans, fish, birds, small mammals, and eggs. Some larger species, like the Komodo dragon, are capable of taking down large prey such as deer and water buffalo. They use their keen sense of smell and sharp teeth to hunt and consume their food.</p>

    <section id="reproduction">
        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>Monitor lizards reproduce by laying eggs. Females typically lay their eggs in burrows, rotting vegetation, or other protected environments. The number of eggs varies by species, with some laying only a few eggs, while others can lay up to 30. The incubation period ranges from a few months to almost a year, depending on the species and environmental conditions.</p>

    <section id="conservation">
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>Many monitor lizard species are threatened by habitat loss, poaching, and the illegal pet trade. Conservation efforts focus on habitat protection, legal regulations to prevent poaching and trading, and breeding programs to ensure their survival. Education and awareness programs are also crucial in promoting the importance of these remarkable reptiles in their ecosystems.</p>
