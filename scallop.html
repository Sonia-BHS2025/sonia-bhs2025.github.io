        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Scallops are marine bivalve mollusks belonging to the family Pectinidae. Renowned for their fan-shaped shells and succulent meat, scallops are both ecologically significant and highly valued as a seafood delicacy. They inhabit oceans worldwide, contributing to diverse marine ecosystems and human culinary traditions.</p>

    <section id="appearance">
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Scallops have a distinct appearance characterized by their ribbed, fan-shaped shells, which can vary in color from white to deep red or orange. The two shells, or valves, are often smooth and are hinged together by a ligament. Inside, scallops have a central adductor muscle, which is the part commonly eaten, and numerous tiny eyes along the edge of their mantle that help them detect movement and light.</p>

    <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Scallops are found in various marine environments, including shallow coastal waters, estuaries, and the deep sea. They typically prefer sandy or gravelly substrates where they can bury themselves partially. Some species are free-swimming and can move by clapping their shells together, expelling water to propel themselves.</p>

    <section id="behavior">
        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Scallops exhibit interesting behaviors, such as the ability to swim by rapidly clapping their shells. This movement is both a means of escaping predators and a way to reposition themselves within their habitat. They are filter feeders, consuming plankton and organic matter by filtering water through their gills.</p>

    <section id="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>The diet of scallops primarily consists of plankton and small particles of organic matter suspended in the water. They use their gills to filter these food particles from the water, a process that also helps maintain water quality in their environment. Scallops play a crucial role in the marine food web as both filter feeders and prey for larger marine animals.</p>

    <section id="reproduction">
        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>Scallops reproduce by releasing eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs externally. This process typically takes place in warmer months. The fertilized eggs develop into free-swimming larvae, which eventually settle on the seabed and metamorphose into juvenile scallops. They grow rapidly, reaching maturity in one to two years.</p>

    <section id="conservation">
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>Scallops face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change. Conservation efforts focus on sustainable fishing practices, habitat restoration, and research on scallop populations and their environments. Protecting scallop habitats is crucial for maintaining their populations and the overall health of marine ecosystems.</p>
