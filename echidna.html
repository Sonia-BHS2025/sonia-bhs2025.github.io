        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Echidnas, also known as spiny anteaters, are unique egg-laying mammals belonging to the family Tachyglossidae. They are one of the few surviving monotremes and are native to Australia and New Guinea. Known for their distinctive spines and elongated snouts, echidnas have fascinated scientists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>

    <section id="appearance">
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Echidnas have a distinctive appearance with spines covering their back and sides. These spines are modified hairs made of keratin. They have a long, sticky tongue used for capturing prey, and their bodies are covered in coarse hair. Echidnas are generally small to medium-sized, with body lengths ranging from 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm) and weighing between 4.4 to 22 pounds (2 to 10 kg).</p>

    <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Echidnas are adaptable and can be found in a variety of habitats, including forests, woodlands, grasslands, and deserts. They prefer environments with plenty of ground cover, which provides protection from predators. Echidnas are primarily solitary animals and establish territories based on the availability of food and shelter.</p>

    <section id="behavior">
        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Echidnas are known for their burrowing behavior. They use their powerful claws to dig for food and create burrows for shelter. When threatened, echidnas can dig themselves into the ground or curl into a ball, presenting their spines to deter predators. They are generally nocturnal or crepuscular, being most active during the cooler parts of the day.</p>

    <section id="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>The diet of echidnas mainly consists of ants and termites, which they capture using their long, sticky tongue. They use their strong claws to break open logs and ant nests. Echidnas also consume other invertebrates such as beetles and earthworms.</p>

    <section id="reproduction">
        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>Echidnas have a unique reproductive process among mammals. During the breeding season, females lay a single, leathery egg, which they incubate in a pouch on their abdomen. After about ten days, the egg hatches, and the tiny, underdeveloped echidna, known as a puggle, remains in the pouch for several weeks, feeding on milk secreted from mammary glands.</p>

    <section id="conservation">
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>While echidnas are not currently considered endangered, they face threats from habitat destruction, climate change, and predation by invasive species. Conservation efforts focus on protecting natural habitats and research on their biology and ecology to ensure their continued survival.</p>
