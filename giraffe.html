    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Giraffes are the tallest living terrestrial animals and are known for their long necks and distinctive coat patterns. Belonging to the family Giraffidae, giraffes are native to Africa and are iconic figures in the savannas and open woodlands of the continent.</p>

    <section id="appearance">
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Giraffes have a unique and easily recognizable appearance with their long necks, long legs, and patterned coats. Their coat patterns, consisting of brown patches separated by lighter lines, are unique to each individual. Giraffes can stand between 14 to 18 feet (4.3 to 5.5 meters) tall, with males generally taller than females, and they weigh between 1,600 to 3,000 pounds (800 to 1,300 kilograms).</p>

    <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Giraffes inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands across sub-Saharan Africa. They prefer areas with abundant acacia trees, which provide their primary food source. Giraffes are adaptable to different environments but are most commonly found in regions with open landscapes that allow them to spot predators from a distance.</p>

    <section id="behavior">
        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Giraffes are social animals that form loose herds typically consisting of related females and their offspring, though males are more solitary. They are known for their gentle and curious nature. Giraffes spend most of their day feeding, and their long necks allow them to reach high foliage that other herbivores cannot access. They have a unique gait, moving both legs on one side of their body simultaneously, followed by both legs on the other side.</p>

    <section id="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves, flowers, fruits, and shoots of various trees and shrubs. Acacia trees are a particularly important food source. Giraffes use their long necks and prehensile tongues to browse foliage high in the trees, which minimizes competition with other herbivores. They can consume up to 75 pounds (34 kilograms) of vegetation per day.</p>

    <section id="reproduction">
        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>Giraffes have a gestation period of about 15 months, after which the female gives birth to a single calf, although twins are rare. Calves are born about 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and can stand and walk within hours of birth. They are weaned by six to twelve months but remain close to their mothers for several years. Male giraffes engage in necking battles to establish dominance and win mating opportunities.</p>

    <section id="conservation">
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>Giraffes face threats from habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts focus on habitat protection, anti-poaching measures, and research on giraffe populations and health. Several subspecies of giraffes are listed as vulnerable or endangered, and international organizations are working to ensure their survival.</p>
