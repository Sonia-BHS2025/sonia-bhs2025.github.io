    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Wolf spiders are members of the family Lycosidae, known for their excellent eyesight and agile hunting abilities. Unlike most spiders, wolf spiders do not spin webs to catch prey. Instead, they hunt and pounce on their victims.</p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Wolf spiders are solitary creatures. They are nocturnal hunters and rely on their keen eyesight and speed to capture prey. Unlike many spiders, they carry their egg sacs attached to their spinnerets and the young spiderlings ride on their mother's back after hatching.</p>

    <section id="reproduction">
        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>Wolf spiders reproduce by laying eggs. The female wolf spider carries the egg sac attached to her spinnerets until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the spiderlings climb onto their mother's back and stay there for several days before dispersing.</p>

    <section id="venom">
        <h2>Venom</h2>
        <p>Wolf spiders do possess venom, which they use to immobilize their prey. However, their venom is not harmful to humans. A bite from a wolf spider might cause some pain, swelling, and itching, but it is generally not dangerous.</p>
