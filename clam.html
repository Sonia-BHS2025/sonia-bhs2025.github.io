        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Razor clams are bivalve mollusks belonging to the family Pharidae. Known for their elongated, razor-like shells, these clams are found in coastal waters worldwide. Razor clams are prized for their delicate flavor and are a popular choice in seafood cuisine. They are fascinating creatures, both ecologically and economically significant.</p>

    <section id="appearance">
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Razor clams have a distinctive appearance with long, narrow shells that resemble old-fashioned straight razors. Their shells are typically smooth and can vary in color from light brown to white, often with a glossy finish. The size of razor clams can range from 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 cm) in length, making them larger than many other bivalves.</p>

    <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Razor clams inhabit sandy or muddy coastal waters, typically burrowing into the substrate to depths of up to a meter. They are found in intertidal and subtidal zones, often in areas with strong currents that provide a steady supply of food. Razor clams are commonly found along the coasts of North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>

    <section id="behavior">
        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Razor clams are known for their rapid burrowing abilities, which they use to escape predators and adverse environmental conditions. They have a powerful foot that they extend and contract to dig into the sand quickly. Razor clams are filter feeders, drawing in water through their siphons to extract plankton and other small organic particles for nutrition.</p>

    <section id="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>The diet of razor clams consists primarily of plankton and detritus. As filter feeders, they siphon water through their gills, trapping food particles. This diet is vital for their growth and reproductive success, as it provides the necessary nutrients for these bivalves to thrive in their coastal habitats.</p>

    <section id="reproduction">
        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>Razor clams reproduce by releasing eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs externally. The larvae are planktonic, drifting in the water before settling to the bottom to undergo metamorphosis into juvenile clams. This process is influenced by water temperature and food availability, with spawning typically occurring in the warmer months.</p>

    <section id="conservation">
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>While not currently endangered, razor clams face threats from habitat degradation, overharvesting, and climate change. Conservation efforts focus on sustainable harvesting practices and protecting coastal habitats to ensure healthy populations. Research into their biology and ecology is also crucial for developing effective management strategies.</p>
