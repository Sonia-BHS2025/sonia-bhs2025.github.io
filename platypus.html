        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The platypus is a unique egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. Belonging to the family Ornithorhynchidae, it is one of the only extant monotremes, alongside echidnas. The platypus is renowned for its distinctive appearance, combining features of birds, reptiles, and mammals.</p>

    <section id="appearance">
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>The platypus has a distinctive appearance with a duck-bill, webbed feet, and a beaver-like tail. Its body is covered in dense, waterproof fur that insulates it in cold water. Males are typically larger than females, measuring around 15 inches (38 cm) in length and weighing up to 5.3 pounds (2.4 kg).</p>

    <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Platypuses are semi-aquatic and inhabit freshwater environments such as rivers, streams, and lakes. They prefer areas with abundant vegetation, which provides shelter and food sources. Their burrows are typically dug into the banks of these water bodies.</p>

    <section id="behavior">
        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Platypuses are solitary animals and are mostly nocturnal. They spend much of their time in the water, where they forage for food. Using their sensitive bill, they detect prey through electroreception. Platypuses are excellent swimmers, using their webbed front feet to paddle and their tails for steering.</p>

    <section id="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>The diet of the platypus consists mainly of aquatic invertebrates such as insect larvae, worms, and freshwater shrimp. They also consume small fish and amphibians. Platypuses hunt by diving and using their bill to sift through the mud at the bottom of streams.</p>

    <section id="reproduction">
        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>Platypuses have a unique reproductive process among mammals. Females lay one to three eggs and incubate them by curling around them. After about ten days, the eggs hatch, and the mother nurses the young by secreting milk through pores in her skin, as platypuses lack nipples.</p>

    <section id="conservation">
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>The platypus is currently classified as near threatened due to habitat destruction, climate change, and water pollution. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their natural habitats and monitoring populations to ensure their survival.</p>
